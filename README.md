<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


I wanted to make a quick tool that would intake some data from my newest cohort of students, and I'm excited to use this tool to visualize the data given to me! I want other professors to be able to take the questions given and create their own version so that they can have a bit of engagement from their students.

Why ask students?
* Engagement, of course!
* Being able to see the results of your student's opinions!
* It's en easy project to show off to students/possibly have as a final project for students learning!

There's no way for me to know how this project will progress. I want to add GUI, and data science tools to process through what will be passed back, but for now this is a silly little tool I'll continue to use.
